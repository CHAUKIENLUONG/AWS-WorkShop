### Introduction

Now that we have created a knowledge base that will perform RAG on our support tickets and product data for both Ohmzio and Ampwerks, we will use prompt engineering to test generative AI capabilities based on the data provided.

### Prompt Engineering

As defined in the section introduction, prompt engineering is the method of designing effective prompts that guide the model to produce desired outputs. Here are some best practices to consider when exploring the data source with the knowledge base:

1. Be specific: Specificity helps the model understand the context and deliver more accurate responses. For example, instead of asking "tell me about Ohmzio Smart Bulbs," ask "what are the most common issues with Ohmzio Smart Bulbs?"

2. Use keywords: Incorporate relevant keywords into your prompt that signal the context or domain you're interested in. This helps the model to tune its responses according to the desired topic.

3. Structure prompts: For complex queries, structure your prompt in a logical, step-by-step manner. You might start with a brief introduction to the topic, followed by a specific question or request for explanation.

4. Incorporate examples: When looking for creative or complex outputs, providing examples within your prompt can guide the model towards the kind of response you're seeking.

### Steps

1. Navigate to the Amazon Bedrock [console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home#) .

2. Click **Knowledge bases** in the left menu under the Builder Tools section.

3. Click the radio button next to the merger-knowledge-base we created in the previous section. Then click **Test knowledge base**.

5. In the pop-up window, select **Anthropic, Claude 3.5 Sonnet**, and **On-demand**. Click **Apply**.

6. In a previous lab, you used Amazon QuickSight to discover that Smart Plugs have the highest number of support incidents. Let's use the knowledge base to uncover additional insights about those support incidents.

   1. In the panel with the input box, copy the following prompt, and click Run:

   `What are the most common issues with Ohmzio Smart Plugs?`

   Here is a sample generative response:

   Be aware that the output generated by Knowledge Base may not exactly match the samples provided in the lab guide. As the undifferentiated heavy lifting of training, tuning, and overall improvement of abstracted infrastructure is continuously updated to provide the most performant and reliable experience for end users.

   Note that the response in the console includes references to source details. Source details can be accessed by clicking **Details** at the end of each response. This allows greater transparency for claims the model may make in a given responses.

   2.  What actions can you take to avoid calls to support? Use the knowledge base to gain even more insights.

   `How can we update our documentation to avoid some of these unnecessary calls to support?`

   {{%notice%}}
   The knowledge base contains product manuals and support ticket history. Based on this information, the LLM produces actions that can be taken to improve documentation and reducing the number of support calls.
