### Congratulations!

You have just completed setting up a Product and Support Knowledge base!

### Summary

In this lab, you:

1. Learned the basics of Retrieval-Augmented Generagion (RAG) and prompt engineering.

2. Created an Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base.

  1. Deployed Vector Engine for Amazon OpenSearch Serverless

  2. Used Amazon Titan to create vector embeddings.

3. Tested the knowledge base by interacting with a Large Language Model (LLM).

### Next Steps

When you created the knowledge base, on OpenSearch Serverless vector store was created.
