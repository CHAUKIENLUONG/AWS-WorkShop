### Congratulations!

You have just completed the **Advanced QuickSight** lab!

### Summary

In this lab, you:

1. Created and tested an QuickSight Q topic to empower natural language interactions with customer support data.
2. Used BI stories to generate detailed explanations about the data visualizations created in the data discovery lab.

### Next Steps

Explore creating additional Q topics on new data sources. If you created an Ampwerks Analysis in the earlier exercise, create a Q topic. You may also explore additional data, such as orders placed.

How can QuickSight Q improve data literacy within your organization?
