9. In the Story screen that appears, navigate to the Build data story modal and copy this sample data story prompt in **Describe the data story you need**. Hint: For the best results, don't phrase the prompt like a question. Instead, type the data story that you want QuickSight to build.

`Explain the trends in support tickets by products and regions. Recommend the areas where we need course of correction.`

10. Choose **Add visuals** to add the visuals that support your story.

11. Choose the **Customer Support Dashboard** dashboard from **All dashboards** list and select all three visuals of your analysis i.e. **Support Tickets per Month, Tickets by Product Category, Tickets by Product**
