### Background

In this lab, we will use **Amazon QuickSight Q Generative BI capabilities** to ask and answer questions about the customer support data, and generate data stories on the datasets we created in the data discovery lab to further assist with support tickets.

### Amazon QuickSight Q

Amazon QuickSight Q powered by machine learning, uses natural language processing to answer your business questions quickly and accelerate data-driven decisions with humanistic Q&A. Amazon QuickSight Q aims to democratize data exploration and make data insights more transparent and consumable through interactive, narrative visual analysis for better data informed decisions. By using Q, you can save weeks of effort on the part of your business intelligence (BI) teams, who otherwise might have to build predefined data models and dashboards.

### Topics

Q Topics are collections of one or more datasets that represent a subject area that your business users can ask questions about. When you create a topic, your business users can ask questions about it in the Q bar. At any time, you can open a topic to change it or review how it's performing.

### Data Stories

With Amazon Q in QuickSight, authors and readers can generate a first draft of their data story quickly. Use **Amazon Q prompts** and visuals to produce a draft that incorporates the details that you provide. Data story drafts are not meant to replace your own ideas or to perform analysis. Rather, data stories are a starting point to customize and expand on as needed. Amazon Q's contextual recommendations and suggestions combine your prompt with selected visuals to provide relevant details that are tailored to your data story.

For **business users** AI-generated **data stories** are completely customizable,beautifully formatted narratives that describe data, and include visuals, images, and text in document or slide format directly that can easily be shared with others within QuickSight.
